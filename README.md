# 14.2 Derivative-of-a-function
Use MATLAB to find the graph of the derivative of the function

𝑓(𝑥) = 5𝑥^2e^−0.2xsin(𝑥)

 Set up an x-array from 0 to 10 with an increment of 0.01
• Calculate the y-array that matches that x-array
• Find the central difference estimate of the derivative
• Plot the original function and the derivative on two separate graphs
• Include a grid, titles and axis labels
• Set both x axes to run from 0 to 10

# 14.3 Special Functions for Polynomials
MATLAB has special functions to find the derivative or integral of a polynomial function.

Write a script that will ask the user for the coefficients and integration constant of a cubic function
𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑎𝑥^3 + 𝑏𝑥^2 + 𝑐x + 𝑑 Integration Constant= 𝑦𝑜
Then, it will report the functions for the derivative and integral of this function.
